*Welcome to Cruddy’s Car Parts*

In this Solution Pattern, you will be using two applications from a fictitious company called Cruddy’s Car Parts. Both applications are built with PatternFly, an open source design system, and Node.js.

* {create-messages-app} - Provides a RESTful API and a user interface to create order messages for customers.
* {retrieve-messages-app} - Uses a RESTful API that is built with Red Hat Fuse for querying and creating orders in an underlying PostgreSQL database.
