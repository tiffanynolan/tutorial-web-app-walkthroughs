Learn how to implement a container-native OpenAPI RESTful API without coding.

Container-native applications::
Applications that are designed to run in a containerised environment.

// This is taken right from https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification
OpenAPI Specification::
A standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs. REST APIs allow both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

In this Solution Pattern you follow a design-first approach, based on the OpenAPI specification, to define a RESTful API that accepts a name parameter and echoes it back in the response body.
You then use the resulting Open API definition to generate the code for your API and deploy it in a containerised environment.

Following a design first approach to API development is self-documenting, and provides a clear API definition for partners and end-users of your API.
It also allows you to identify important design decisions prior to coding and deployment.

== Creating an OpenAPI Spec using API Designer

When creating an API it's beneficial to start from the bottom-up. Creating an
OpenAPI Specification prior to coding forces developers to consider API usage
patterns, provides a blueprint for the API development, and creates an
understanding between the server and clients regarding the behaviour of the
API.

An OpenAPI Specification can be defined in YAML/JSON format. In this section
we'll be using API Designer - a visual design tool - to generate this YAML/JSON
document.

=== Create the Base API Definition

. Go to link:{apicurio-url}[API Designer, window="_blank"]
. Login if prompted and click the new *New API* button.
. Rename your API from "New API" to:
+
----
Greeting API
----

. Edit the *Description* in the *Design* tab on the right under the *INFO* section:
+
----
My greeting API
----

. Click *Add a data type* under the *Data Types* heading on the left of the screen.

. In the *Enter Basic Information* section enter the following in the *Name* field:
+
----
Name
----

. Enter the following JSON in the *Enter JSON Example* field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{
    "name": "shadowman"
}
----

. Make sure *No Resource* is selected in the *Choose to create a REST Resource with the Data Type* section.
. Scroll down and click *Save*.

[type=verification]
Is `</> Name` listed under the *Data Types* on the left of the screen?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.


=== Creating a POST Resource Path

A *Path* represents an API endpoint/operation and the associated parameters required to invoke it.

. Click *Add a path* under the *Paths* heading of the *Provide API Definition* screen.

. In the window that appears, enter the following in the *Path* field:
+
----
/greeting
----

. Click *Add* to confirm your entry.

. Click your new */greeting* endpoint under the *Paths* heading.

. Click the *Create Operation* button for *POST* in the *Operations* section. The *POST* item will become an orange button.

. Click the now orange *POST* button to access the *Design* screen for the *POST* operation.

. Enter the following in the now visible *Summary* field:
+
----
Greet with name
----

. Enter the following in the *Operation ID* field:
+
----
greetname
----

. In the *Request Body* section, click *Add a request body*.

. Choose *Name* as the type from the dropdown.

. In the *Responses* section click *Add a response*.
.. In the window that appears choose *200 OK* as the option.
.. Click *Add*.
.. Click *No description* beside the *200 OK* response and enter the following in the *Description* field:
+
----
Greeting response
----
.. Click *No Type* and change the *Type* field to *String as String*.
. Click *Save* in the top right corner of the page to save your work.

=== Export the OpenAPI Spec as JSON/YAML

. Click the down arrow beside *Save As...* in the top right.
. Choose *Save as YAML*.

+
NOTE: Keep this file safe. It will be used to create the API implementation in Fuse Online shortly.

== Creating a Slack Connection in Fuse Online

In Fuse Online a *Connection* holds the information required to connect to a service.
For example, a Slack *Connection* in Fuse Online requires an *API Token* and *Slack URL* to function.

. Click *Next* to go to the *Operations* screen.

[type=verification]
Is a *POST /greeting* operation displayed on the *Operations* screen in Fuse Online?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you created the POST operation correctly in the OpenAPI Spec using API Designer. Contact an administrator if the problem persists.

=== Create a Flow for the API Operation

. Click the *Create flow* button for the *POST /greeting* item. The *Add to Integration* page appears displaying the *Provided API* and the *Provided API Return Path*.
. Click the blue plus icon in the center to add a step.
. Select the *Greeting Slack Target* on the *Choose a connection* screen. This will add a step between the *Provided API* and the *Provided API Return Path*.
. When prompted to *Choose an action* select *Channel*. You can use this to send a message to a specific channel in your Slack workspace.
. Use the *Channel* menu to select the *low-code-demo* channel and click *Next*.
The *Add to Integration* screen should now display your Slack connection with a triangular *Data Type Mismatch* warning icon.
. Click the *Warning Icon* on the Slack *Channel* panel and choose *Add a data mapping step*.
. From the *Data Mapper* screen click the *body* field in the *Source* panel to expand it.
. Click the *name* field under the *body*, then click the *message* field in the *Target* panel. This maps the value of the incoming HTTP request *body* to the outgoing Slack *message* property.
. In the right hand *Mapping Details* panel, click the *Add Transformation* under the *Targets* section to add a transformation.
. Change the transformation type from *Append* to *Prepend*.

. Click the *Warning Icon* on the *Provided API Return Path* panel and choose *Add a data mapping step*.

. From the *Data Mapper* screen click the *Message* heading in the *Source* panel to expand it.

. Click the *message* field under the *Message* heading in the *Source* panel.
. Select the *body* field in the *Target* panel. This maps the *message* value from the created Slack message to the *body* of the outgoing HTTP response.

. Click *Done* to return to the *Add to Integration* Editor.

. Click *Publish*, then enter the name:
+
----
Greeting Integration {user-username}
----

. Click *Save and Publish* to trigger an link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/creating_images/s2i.html[Source to Image (S2I), window="_blank", id="{context}-2"] build.

. Wait until Fuse Online reports your build and deployment was successful. Move onto the *Protecting APIs* Solution Pattern to securely expose and test this API using Red Hat 3scale API Management.

[type=verification]
Does the Fuse Online *Home* screen list your *Post Slack Greeting API* with a blue box that contains the text *Running*?
