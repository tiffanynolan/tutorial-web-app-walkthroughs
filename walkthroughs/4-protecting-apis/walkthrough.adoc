== Importing an API to 3scale using Service Discovery
:context: import-api
=== API Management Login

. Open the link:{api-management-url}[{3scale-name} Login screen, window="_blank", id="{context}-1"].

. Select the *Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On* option. This triggers an OAuth Flow and redirects you to the {3scale-name} Dashboard.

. Dismiss the *How does 3Scale work?* option which is displayed the first time you log in to {3scale-name}. The main Dashboard is displayed.

[type=verification]
Can you see the {3scale-name} Dashboard that shows the Audience and APIs panels?

[type=verificationFail]
{standard-fail-text}


=== Import the API to Red Hat 3scale

. From the *APIs* section of the *Dashboard*, select the *New Product* item.
. Select the *Import from OpenShift* option. If this option is not enabled, click the *Authenticate to enable this option* link and choose *Allow selected permissions*.
. If you used the *Authenticate to enable this option* link, verify that you have reselected *Import from OpenShift* after being redirected.
. Verify that the *fuse* option is selected from the *Namespace* list.
. Verify that the *i-greeting-api-{user-username}* is selected from the *Name* list.
. Click *Create Product*.
+
The import process can take a few minutes to complete.

[type=verification]
Can you see the *i-greeting-integration-{user-username}* listed in the *APIs* section of the 3scale Dashboard ?

[type=verificationFail]
Wait a little longer, or try the import again. {standard-fail-text} 

[time=10]
== Configuring the API

=== Set the Staging Environment API URL
. Navigate to the link:{api-management-url}[{3scale-name} 3scale Dashboard, window="_blank"], logging if necessary.
. Choose *i-greeting-integration-{user-username}* from the top navigation menu to view the {3scale-name} homepage.
+
NOTE: If the *i-greeting-integration-{user-username}* is not listed in the top navigation menu that means it is still being imported. Wait a while, refresh the page, and try again.

. Select the *Settings* item in the *Integration* dropdown menu on the left.

.. In the *Staging Public Base URL*, enter:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{route}
----
+
NOTE: We change the URL because the default one generated is usually too long and will fail to resolve.

.. Scroll down and click *Update Product* at the bottom of the page.

=== Create a Mapping Rule for the Greeting Endpoint

. Choose *Integration > Mapping Rules* from the left menu.

. Click *Add Mapping Rule*.

. Select the *POST* option for *Verb*.

. Enter the `/greeting` for the *Pattern*.

. Click the *Create Mapping Rule* button.

. Choose the *Configuration* item in the *Integration* dropdown menu. 
+
Note: There is a warning icon next to this link that suggests promoting the configuration to the Staging Environment.

. On the *Configuration* screen click *Promote v.2 to Staging*.

[type=verification]
Is the staging environment listed in the *Environments* section on the *Integration > Configuration* screen with the route {route} listed?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

[time=10]
== Creating an Application and Application Plan

Note that the *Example curl for testing* listed for the *Staging Environment* contains a placeholder API Key (*user_key* querystring parameter). To address this, and obtain a valid API Key that enables a client to consume the API, the API must be added as an *Application* within a developer account. This *Application* must be part of an *Application Plan*. The *Application Plan* is used to define pricing, limits, methods, and metrics.

=== Create an Application Plan

. Select *Applications > Application Plans* from the side navigation.
. Select *Create Application Plan*.
. Enter the following for *Name* and *System name*:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
low-code
----
. Leave the other fields with their default values.
. Select *Create Application Plan*. You will be redirected to the *Application Plans* screen.
. Click *Publish*, beside your plan list item, to publish the Plan.

=== Create an Application
In this step a new *Application* will be created for the *Developer* Group,  assigned to the *Application Plan* created in the previous section.

. Select *Audience* from the top navigation menu.
. Select the *Developer* Account to open the *Account Summary* page.
. Select the *(num) Application* item from the breadcrumb (below the top navigation menu) to view the developer's Applications.
. Select the *Create Application* button in the top right.
. Select the *low-code* Plan in the *Application plan* dropdown under the *i-greeting-integration-{user-username}* heading.
. Enter the following for *Name* and *Description*:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
low-code-app-{user-username}
----
. Select *Create Application*.

. Set a custom *User Key* for the application:
. On the *low-code-app-{user-username}* Application screen you were redirected to, scroll to the *API Credentials* section.
. Click the green pencil icon beside the *API User Key*
. In the *Set Custom User Key* modal dialog, enter:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{sample-api-key}
----
. Select *Set Custom Key*.


[type=verification]
Return to the *Integration > Configuration* screen. Does the *Example curl for testing* under the *Staging Environment* show `user_key={sample-api-key}`?

[type=verificationFail]
{standard-fail-text}


=== Invoking the API

. Use an HTTP client such as cURL to invoke the `POST /greeting` route, for example:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -d '{"name":"John"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "{route}/greeting?user_key={sample-api-key}"
----

[type=verification]
Did the message "Hello from John" appear in your Slack channel?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.
